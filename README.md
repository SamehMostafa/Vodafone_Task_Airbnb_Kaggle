Airbnb provides service to arrange or offer lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences.


New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand
